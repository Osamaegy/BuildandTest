# Logic Gates with Testing

## Overview
This project implements basic logic gates and arithmetic circuits in Python, including AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, and NOT gates, as well as a half adder, full adder, and 8-bit adder. Each gate and circuit is tested using unit tests written in `pytest`.

## Features
- **Logic Gates**: AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, NOT
- **Arithmetic Circuits**:
  - **Half Adder**: Calculates the sum and carry of two bits.
  - **Full Adder**: Extends the half adder to include a carry-in bit.
  - **8-bit Adder**: Chains eight full adders to perform binary addition on two 8-bit binary numbers.
